# Walk Your Dog Simulator
#### Authors: Erin Paranal, Maureen VonHassel, Yuna Ukawa
This is an object-oriented text-based game project for CS262 at Sacred Heart University, written in Python.  

In our “walk your dog simulator,” you will get to experience the tasks of taking care of a dog that is customizable to your liking. After giving the dog a name and choosing its color, you’ll start to walk your dog through numerous places. You’ll need to keep your dog happy and healthy by taking care of it as best as you can. This includes monitoring its hunger and thirst, as well as cleaning up any waste it accumulates. 

The player needs to walk the dog while encountering different events. For example, your dog could run into another friendly dog to play with, or it could run into a dog that’s aggressive. You will need to get through these events with appropriate behavior before moving on to the next location. Once you get through the city, you’ll beat the game!

You will start the game in your backyard to get used to the actions while walking your dog through the backyard. This is the easiest stage in the game, consisting of far fewer events than the rest of the stages. The next place you go to is the streets of the neighborhood. Afterwards, you go to the dog park. The next location is the beach. Lastly, you and your dog will go to the city, the most challenging stage. With each stage, the dog’s hunger and thirst will decrease.

Many events could arise while you walk your dog through these places. You may have to clean up your dog in the easier stages, while harder stages could include facing friendly or hostile pets. You will have to choose how you or your dog reacts to move onto another stage. For example, if you need to clean up after your dog and don’t, you can lose reputation points. Or, if you face an aggressive dog and decide to attack it, you will have to restart the stage.

This fun and interactive game will teach the player how to take care of a dog while encountering many events that could happen in real life.
